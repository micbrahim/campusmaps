Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

1. Changed the string names of the edges and nodes generic, replacing the previous string implementation
2. Changed the JUnit test and test driver files to now accept the generic nodes and edges.
3. Changed representation of graph from using lists to now using sets, to reduce time complexity.
