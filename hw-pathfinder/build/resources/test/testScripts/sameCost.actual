# Finds path with Dijkstra's algo when multiple paths have same cost

created graph g1

added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1
added node n3 to g1
added node n4 to g1

added edge 1.000 from n1 to n2 in g1
added edge 1.000 from n2 to n4 in g1
added edge 1.000 from n1 to n3 in g1
added edge 1.000 from n3 to n4 in g1

path from n1 to n4:
n1 to n3 with weight 1.000
n3 to n4 with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
