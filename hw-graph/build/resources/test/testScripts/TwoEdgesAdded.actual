# tests adding two edges from one node of a graph to another node.
# tests valid parent-child relationship

# create graph
created graph g1

# add two nodes
added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1

# creates two edges coming from one edge to the other
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in g1

# list children of the parent node
the children of n1 in g1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2)
