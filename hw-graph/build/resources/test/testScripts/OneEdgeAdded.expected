# tests adding an edge, connecting two nodes of a graph, also testing out valid
# parent-child relationship

# create graph
created graph g1

# add two nodes
added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1

# create and edge between the two nodes
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g1

# list child of parent node
the children of n1 in g1 are: n2(e1)
