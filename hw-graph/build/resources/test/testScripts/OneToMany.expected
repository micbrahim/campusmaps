# tests a parent node that has edges coming from node to two other nodes.
# tests validity of parent-child relationship

# create empty graph
created graph g1

# add three nodes
added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1
added node n3 to g1

# creates two edges coming from the same node to two different nodes
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in g1

# list children of parent node
the children of n1 in g1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2)
