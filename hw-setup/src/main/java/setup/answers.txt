## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    It failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because the FibTerm method checked if n was less than or equal to 0 to throw an exception. However, 0 is a nonnegative number, so I had to change the condition to strictly less than 0 to fix this.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    It failed the testBaseCase because since the term at 0 threw an exception, the base case of 0 got assigned to be a negative number and therefor did not pass the test. I did not have to fix anything directly for this issue, because fixing the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException in turn fixes the testBaseCase.

3. Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    It failed the testInductiveCase because the original Fibonacci code had its base-cases as 0, 1, and 2 because of the <= 2. Because 2 was a base case, its value was 1 instead of being 3. By making this condition a strictly less than 2, the base cases will only be 0 and 1, allowing 2 to have its correct value.


## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?

4, 4, and 0. x was not equal to the first integer entered because of integer arithmetic, not being able to contain a decimal value. So, by removing the equation and just assigning the nextInt to x, it solves this problem.



2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when 
the Debug perspective first opened.)

x = 3, y = 4. The frames tab lists the current method and line as computeSum, on line 43.

3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?

1st step over: x = 3, y = 4
2nd step over: x = 3, y = 4, sum = -1
